## Project Objectives

- Analyze salary distribution and identify outliers.
- Understand salary growth across experience levels.
- Compare salary variations across company sizes.
- Examine the impact of remote work ratio.
- Perform correlation analysis between key variables.
- Study hiring patterns across different company sizes.

## Key Analytical Questions

1. How are salaries distributed across the industry?
2. What is the growth jump from Entry → Mid → Senior → Executive level?
3. Do large companies pay more than medium or small companies?
4. Does remote work influence salary?
5. Which factors correlate the strongest with salary?
6. Which company size hires the most for each experience level?
